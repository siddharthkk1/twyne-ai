    // Enhanced prompt for more authentic intros with gender specification
    const prompt = `You are creating warm, authentic introductions between people who would genuinely connect. Your goal is to identify ONE meaningful connection point that would make two people excited to meet.

PHILOSOPHY:
- Focus on deeper resonance: shared values, life philosophy, personality alignment, or meaningful experiences
- Look for authentic compatibility, not surface-level similarities
- Write as if you're a thoughtful friend making an introduction
- Emphasize WHY this connection would be meaningful, not just WHAT they have in common

USER PROFILE CONTEXT:
${JSON.stringify(profileData, null, 2)}

GUIDELINES:
1. Find AT LEAST ONE core connection point that demonstrates genuine compatibility. Focus on values, mindset, life approach, or meaningful shared experiences
2. Include 1 or 2 specific, personal traits, interests, routines, or quirks (e.g., a favorite author, a creative habit, a morning ritual). These make the intros feel real and grounded.
3. Use natural, conversational language - avoid lists or bullet points
4. Write 2 sentences or 1 longer sentence maximum per intro
5. Make it feel like a warm recommendation from a mutual friend
6. Avoid many over-specific details that feel forced or researched
7. IMPORTANT: Specify gender as either "male" or "female" for each person

AUTHENTICITY CHECKS:
- Would this intro make both people curious to meet?
- Does it highlight meaningful compatibility beyond surface interests?
- Does it sound like something a thoughtful friend would say?
- Is it specific enough to be genuine but not so specific it feels researched?

Create 3 warm introduction scenarios with gender diversity. Each should feel authentic and focus on one meaningful connection point.

Format as JSON:
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "name": "First Name",
      "introText": "Natural introduction focusing on one meaningful connection",
      "tags": ["3-4 authentic connection descriptors"],
      "gender": "male" or "female"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLE GOOD INTROS:
- "You and Priya both annotate your favorite fiction with color-coded tabs, and you're drawn to conversations where people talk about their inner world, not just what they do."
- "You and Maya both believe in following your curiosity over having a fixed plan, and you're both in that exciting phase of figuring out what really matters to you."
- "You and Jordan share that rare combination of being deeply thoughtful but also action-oriented - you both think carefully but aren't afraid to take meaningful risks."
- "You and Dani both collect oddly specific Spotify playlists for every mood‚Äîshe's the type to send you a "rainy Tuesday reset" mix unprompted. You'd probably end up swapping weird podcast recs and half-serious dream jobs over boba.
- "You and Priya both have entire personality eras based on Taylor Swift albums‚Äîshe swears she was in her "Folklore phase" all last winter, and she's the type to dissect lyrics like they're journal entries. You'd probably end up trading playlists and life theories in the same breath."
