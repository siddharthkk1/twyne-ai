            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Twyne was born from a simple observation: the best connections happen when people truly understand each other. Traditional dating apps focus on photos and brief profiles, but real compatibility runs much deeper.

              Our AI doesn't just match based on shared interestsâ€”it understands communication styles, life goals, values, and the subtle nuances that make relationships work. The result is connections that feel natural and meaningful from the very first conversation.

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              We're building a world where technology enhances human connection rather than replacing it, where algorithms serve authentic relationships rather than engagement metrics.
