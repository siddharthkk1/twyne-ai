              <p>
                We're more connected than ever‚Äîand somehow, still lonelier than ever.
                Social isolation has quietly become one of the biggest public health issues
                of our time. The U.S. Surgeon General has called loneliness an epidemic.
                Anxiety, disconnection, and emotional flatness are rising‚Äîespecially among
                young adults.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have feeds, group chats, dating apps, and DMs... but for a lot of people,
                <strong> true friendship still feels out of reach.</strong>
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>You move to a new city and don't know where to start</li>
                <li>You graduate, and suddenly your social circle disappears</li>
                <li>You work remotely, and your days feel quiet‚Äîeven with constant notifications</li>
                <li>You want to connect, but don't want to swipe through bios or show up to a room full of strangers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This isn't just about being alone. It's about <strong>not feeling understood.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">ü§ù What We're Building</h2>
              <p>
                Twyne is a new kind of social app‚Äîone that actually helps people meet others
                who feel like a natural fit.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>No swiping. No personal branding. No pressure.</li>
                <li>You chat with our AI‚Äîit gets to know your personality, energy, interests, and life.</li>
                <li>Once a week, it introduces you to someone nearby you're likely to vibe with.</li>
                <li>You can chat, meet up, or just see where it goes. No stress. No script.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We believe in quiet social magic. Not hypergrowth. Not virality. Just people meeting people‚Äî
                naturally, meaningfully, one good intro at a time.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">üí° Why We Exist</h2>
              <p>
                Twyne exists because modern life makes real connection hard‚Äîand that doesn't have to be the case.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're not here to replace human connection with tech. We're here to use tech to <strong>clear the noise
                and create space</strong> for real relationships to form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because everyone deserves to feel seen. Everyone deserves to feel chosen. And everyone deserves to
                find people they genuinely vibe with.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">üåÜ The Vision</h2>
              <p>
                We don't just want to help people make new friends. We want to help reshape how connection feels in modern life.
              </p>
              <p>
                We imagine a world where cities feel smaller, and friendships feel easier. Where you can move to a new neighborhood and easily meet people. Where your social life isn't built on swipes or group chats ‚Äî it's built on small, genuine moments that grow over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this world, no one goes weeks without feeling connected. Connection isn't a project ‚Äî it's part of the background of your life.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's what we're working toward. Not a feed. Not a dopamine rush.
                Just a slower, softer, more human kind of social network ‚Äî one that helps us all feel a little more at home, wherever we are.
