            <p>
              We're more connected than ever‚Äîand somehow, still lonelier than ever.
              Social isolation has quietly become one of the biggest public health issues
              of our time. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">U.S. Surgeon General has called loneliness an epidemic</a>.
              Anxiety, disconnection, and emotional flatness are rising‚Äîespecially among
              young adults.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have feeds, group chats, dating apps, and DMs... but for a lot of people,
              <strong> true friendship still feels out of reach.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>You move to a new city and don't know where to start</li>
              <li>You graduate, and suddenly your social circle disappears</li>
              <li>You work remotely, and your days feel quiet‚Äîeven with constant notifications</li>
              <li>You want to connect, but don't want to swipe through bios or show up to a room full of strangers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn't just about being alone. It's about <strong>not feeling understood.</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">ü§ù What We're Building</h2>
            <p>
              Twyne is a new kind of social app‚Äîone that actually helps people meet others
              who feel like a natural fit.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>No swiping. No personal branding. No pressure.</li>
              <li>You chat with our AI‚Äîit gets to know your personality, energy, interests, and life.</li>
              <li>Once a week, it introduces you to someone nearby you're likely to vibe with.</li>
              <li>You can chat, meet up, or just see where it goes. No stress. No script.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We believe in quiet social magic. Not hypergrowth. Not virality. Just people meeting people‚Äî
              naturally, meaningfully, one good intro at a time.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">üí° Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>
              Twyne exists because modern life makes real connection hard‚Äîand that doesn't have to be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not here to replace human connection with tech. We're here to use tech to <strong>clear the noise
              and create space</strong> for real relationships to form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because everyone deserves to feel seen. Everyone deserves to feel chosen. And everyone deserves to
              find people they genuinely vibe with.
